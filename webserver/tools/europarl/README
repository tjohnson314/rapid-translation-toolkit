Europarl Release v3 -- Sept 27, 2007
===================================

This is a parallel corpus that was extracted from the
European Parliament web site by Philipp Koehn (University 
of Edinburgh). It is faily big, 40 million words per 
language, and its main intended use is to aid 
statistical machine translation research.

More information can be found at
	http://www.statmt.org/europarl/

The main difference in this release vs. the first release
in 2002 and second release in 2003 is that it is larger 
and it comes with improved processing tools that allow 
the creation of parallel corpora between any two of the 
11 languages.

Some data is now tagged with the original language the text
was spoken in.

Sentence aligner
----------------
You can create any parallel corpus with the command

	./sentence-align-corpus.perl L1 L2

where L1 and L2 can be any of the 11 languages
	da de el en es fi fr it nl pt sv

The output is stored in the aligned/ directory.

NOTE: To use this corpus with tools like Giza++, you want to
- lowercase the text (recommended)
- strip empty lines and their correspondences (recommended)
- tokenize words and punctuation (recommended)
- remove lines with XML-Tags (starting with "<") (required) 

The sentence aligner uses the split-sentences.perl script, 
which does and sentence splitting. You may want to 
use your own preprocessor. This requires changing an 
obvious line in the sentence aligner code. A tokenizer.perl
script is included as well.
